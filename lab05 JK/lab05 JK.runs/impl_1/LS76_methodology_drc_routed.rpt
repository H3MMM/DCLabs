2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Jk1/Q_reg_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Jk1/Q_reg_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Jk2/Q_reg_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Jk2/Q_reg_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Jk1/Q_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Jk1/Q_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Jk2/Q_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Jk2/Q_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
